The files in this repository represents the practical documentation of the master's thesis 'Synthesised sound and synthesised composition' by Magnus Bugge, as part of the master's program 'Music Theory' with specialisation in music technology at the Norwegian Academy of Music (Spring 2014).

The abstract of the thesis are as follows:

'This is a master's thesis concentrated around the construction of a suite of digital signal processing routines programmed in Max, with the purpose of composing, or aiding composition of electroacoustic music. The routines are synthesis models operated by arbitrary generated numbers. Sounds produced are used in composition of acousmatic (fixed media) electronic pieces. Further, the processes is evaluated to see if, how and why the composition of electronic music can benefit from being crossed with computer assisted composition. The project is set in an academic context using artistic research as a method to overview, document, and reflect over the project.'
